# Work-Portfolio
Here are two examples of two web applications that I have created with the programming language, Python. First, in the website folder, you'll see my code that is linked in developing a live website with an Ensglish Thesaurus. The link to the website is http://marcuspitter.herokuapp.com/
Second, in the data analysis folder, one will see different interactive data analysis charts. I made the charts using Pandas and Juypter Notebook. I believe it helps to show my analytical skills while having a strong Foundation in Python.
