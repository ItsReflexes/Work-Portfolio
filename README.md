# Work-Portfolio
Here are two examples of two web applications that I have created with the programming language, Python. First, in the website folder, you'll see code that is linked in developing a live website with an Ensglish Thesaurus. The link to the website is http://marcuspitter.herokuapp.com/


Second, in the Interactive data analysis folder, one will see different interactive data analysis charts. I made the charts using Pandas and Juypter Notebook. I believe it helps to show my analytical skills while having a strong foundation in Python.


Third, I have a Tableau chart that represents two different SQL Commands. With data analysis, it's important for one to have a strong foundation in SQl and Python. I believe I have strong analytical skills to work with different data formats and platforms to execute accurate analyzation of data.

Fourth, in the Data Analysis Web App Folder, I have created a web app that collects and sends a user's height value. The results are sent to their desired email. I created this app using Python, Flask, Heroku and PostgreSQL. The link to the web app is https://mp-datashowcase.herokuapp.com/
